                I am Miguel Badayos, an aspiring Software Engineer currently studying Bachelor of Sotware Engineering
                Honours at Charles Darwin University. Growing up and finding interest in technology and engineering, I
                started coding at 2022 during highschool. I have a strong passion and gain satisfaction from developing
                software, especially those that serve a purpose for me or others. That being said, I still enjoy making
                fun and interesting projects at my spare time, making coding one of my hobbies.

            These are the technologies I commonly use or had long experience with for
            development since the starting my coding journey.

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>
                        Python is the first programming language I have used. It is a
                        dynamically typed language famous for its ease-of-use, making it the
                        programming language I am most comfortable with.

                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is the second programming language I used. Similar to Python,
                        it is also dynamically typed and is fairly easy to use, helping me make
                        interactive and functional websites.

                    <h3>TypeScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, having additional features like
                        static typing. The tooling and ecosystem of TypeScript significantly
                        improves its developer experience.

                    <h3>Go</h3>
                    <p>
                        Go is currently my favourite programming language due to its great
                        built-in libraries like the HTTP library, as well as its great
                        performance.

                    <h3>Cloudflare</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cloudflare is a cloud platform that offers various services like
                        Cloudflare Registrar. Cloudflare Pages is my go-to way to host
                        serverless websites for free.

                    <h3>Docker</h3>
                    <p>
                        Docker is a tool that allows software to be containerised, ensuring that
                        the software runs consistently accross multiple devices from development
                        to production.

                    <p>
                        As someone who creates multiple copies for each version before learning
                        Git, it has made developing more convinient especially in a groupwork.

                    <h3>Arch Linux</h3>
                    <p>
                        I do not usually say this but, I use Arch btw. Linux in general is a
                        great operating system especially for development due to the CLI tools
                        built on it.

                    <h3>Neovim</h3>
                    <p>
                        Neovim is a text editor in the terminal that have a great ecosystem. It
                        has helped me enjoy coding 10x more and made me code faster.
