                    I am Miguel Badayos, an aspiring Software Engineer currently studying
                    Bachelor of Sotware Engineering Honours at Charles Darwin University.
                    Growing up and finding interest in technology and engineering, I started
                    coding at 2022 during highschool. I have a strong passion and gain
                    satisfaction from developing software, especially those that serve a purpose
                    for me or others. That being said, I still enjoy making fun and interesting
                    projects at my spare time, making coding one of my hobbies.

                            Python is the first programming language I have used. It is a
                            dynamically typed language famous for its ease-of-use, making it the
                            programming language I am most comfortable with.

                            JavaScript is the second programming language I used. Similar to
                            Python, it is also dynamically typed and is fairly easy to use,

                            TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, having additional features
                            like static typing. The tooling and ecosystem of TypeScript
                            significantly improves its developer experience.
