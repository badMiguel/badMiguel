                I am Miguel Badayos, an aspiring Software Engineer currently studying Bachelor of Sotware Engineering
                Honours at Charles Darwin University. Growing up and finding interest in technology and engineering, I
                started coding at 2022 during highschool. I have a strong passion and gain satisfaction from developing
                software, especially those that serve a purpose for me or others. That being said, I still enjoy making
                fun and interesting projects at my spare time, making coding one of my hobbies.
